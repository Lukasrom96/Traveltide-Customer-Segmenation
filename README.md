*This Notebook provides a Customer-Segmentation Analysis of the Traveltide-Company*

*Disclaimer: This is a first approach on a limited data-foundation and not a complete result. It is meant to showcase how one can start a segmentation process which needs to be evaluated and updated with additional data.* 

E-booking startup TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Customer feedback has shown - and industry analysts agree - that TravelTide customers have access to the largest travel inventory in the e-booking space.

Following the startup playbook, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building an unfair advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, building the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention.
